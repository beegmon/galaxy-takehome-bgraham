Part 1: 
Given the attached app.py please do the following:

1. Write a Dockerfile to package this flask Application as a container.
2. Write the necessary Kubernetes manifests to deploy this container as a web application.
3. Incorporate a dummy URL this application would respond on.

Requirements:

- Treat this as introducing a new application into an already existing Kubernetes cluster that already has a number of other
 web applications deployed. The Kubernetes files should be designed with Production quality, High Availability, and Scalability in mind.
- Do not affix the Application Pod to a static port on the host.
- Reproducibility. Use the most efficient cloud costs management approach when creating your manifests in case
 the company decides to create 20 additional similar applications.
